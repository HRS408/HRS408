        "# **Introduction to Machine Learning**\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming. Instead of relying on hard-coded rules, machine learning algorithms use statistical techniques to identify patterns and make predictions based on the provided data.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Types of Machine Learning**\n",
        "There are three main types of machine learning:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where each data point includes the desired output or target variable. The algorithm learns to map the input features to the output labels and can then make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Example: Training a model to predict house\n",
        "prices based on features like size, location, and age. The dataset would include historical house prices as the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Two main types:\n",
        "\n",
        " * Classification: Predicting a categorical output.\n",
        "   * Example: Classifying emails as spam or not spam.\n",
        "   * Regression: Predicting a continuous output.\n",
        "Example: Predicting stock prices.\n",
        "2. Unsupervised Learning: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset, where the target variable is not provided. The algorithm aims to discover patterns and relationships in the data without any prior knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Example: Grouping customers based on their purchase history. The algorithm would identify clusters of customers with similar buying behavior.\n",
        "* Main type:\n",
        "  * Clustering: Grouping data points based on similarity.\n",
        "    * Example: Customer segmentation.\n",
        "3. Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to interact with an environment by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties. The agent's goal is to learn a policy that maximizes its cumulative reward over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Example: Training a robot to navigate a maze. The robot receives rewards for reaching the goal and penalties for hitting obstacles.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Steps Involved in Supervised Learning\n",
        "1. Data Collection: Gather labeled data relevant\n",
        "to the problem.\n",
        "1. Data Preparation: Clean, preprocess, and transform the data. Handle missing values, outliers, and convert categorical variables.\n",
        "1. Feature Selection: Select relevant features that contribute most to the prediction.\n",
        "1. Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning model based on the problem type (classification or regression).\n",
        "1. Model Training: Train the selected model using the labeled data.\n",
        "1. Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
        "1. Model Tuning: Fine-tune model parameters to optimize performance.\n",
        "1. Deployment: Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data."
